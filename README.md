# Mess Management System
Mess management system project is a project to manage all the basic functionalities of any Mess/restaurant like record register new user, delete user, manage daily attendance, pay 
mess fees, check mess progress etc.

## Features
Mess management system project is useful for providing some functionalities online so that users can know about the mess
restaurant like what is the today’s meal, what is tomorrow’s meal, what is the full week menu, user’s feedback and review etc.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the Repo: https://github.com/abz8298Mess-Management-System.git

## Future Roadmap
🤝This project can be useful to any school/college hostel or in general to any institute maintaining a mess or canteen. Security is maintained as the complete control of the system is only under the hands of an authorized person. It will enable mess managers to refer diet charts and plan. It will also enable admin to mark the attendance of a user to identify unauthorized person. It will also provide the functionality to manage users and their fees status.

Also, this project will increase the ease of accessibility and reduce paper/file work as users can check everything online and get registered yourself.

## Vision Statement
➡️It helps the user to access all the functionalities of the mess without having to visit the mess phyically.😂
